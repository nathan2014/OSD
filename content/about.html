About my organic seo company

When I began doing search engine optimization, I was excited and alos baffled, I had come off of a heap of time trying to decipher what exactly the world wide web was, innately going through technical documents, and browsing explanations from web technology leaders on the topic.

I would come across psychology field explanations, speaking to the communication medium's strengths, search as a new expanse of information discovery, all the way to information security's woes on what a clutter it had become in the face of a dot com boom and bust, it seemed all was lost, and my only hope or salvation if you will, was the complex construction of animated user interfaces incorporating high value data as long term assets to corporations as well as people, either in the interest of education OR entertainment.

Spirit

My company as my self will never be supportive of information discovery baring a societal nakedness of the likes we did and have been seeing, the perverse usage of data retrieval optimization in online gaming as in gambling, the pornography industry, pharmaceutical sales from places like Mexico and Canada, truly a horrible reality I had been aware of but had already truly changed who I was, and not positively in any way.

I had to do something (again), and this time I was adament to ever give up, at least on my self, and what I believed, part of me did give up, on the idea we could use the technology to create a controlled consumption, sadly I was lost to the idea that technology could be secured, like what we see in block chain, that it could make our lives better without being open to inherent criminal activity.

I ran to affiliate marketing, I was already using SEO, I learned basic search optimization before I had learned it, basically when I learned web site design using HTML and CSS, in the late 2000's.
It was then, when I came across acai supplements, and looked at a very dismal artifact of human ingenuity, a lack of quality goods I could change ANY life with, I was a grandiose thinker. And at which time I began to reall say, to myself, graphic design and UX with web design and understanding of the actual data would be all I could do to escape. That would be a very big shortcoming for someone as educated as myself, quite little math in my education being my quam, but not enough to stop me from starting my slow crawl to being proficient in that combination of skills, safe to say I would not give up because I didn't give up before and I always got what I needed if not wanted, just from being persistent.

So I began, my company started with Acai supplement and quickly became about the Bayes algorithm, that same algorithm shapes everything I do, I could not finish the liturgical read, I knew it was a winner, the algorithm promised to deliver a predictabliity to an unstable world, unfortunately though close, google is STILL catching up.

I wanted to make a real difference and be able to sell things as a real person, not unsubstantiated, and my heart wanted to complete a dream I don't own, we all own this dream, it's god's, man's, animals, we have to leverage complexity to save, nature didn't leverage this for us, man has a nature that all to often fails him, Bayes theorem would change this, I said, and I still say it.

All I can say is this, if we can measure anything using the help of Artificial Intelligence, then couldn't it be used to measure itself?

We need to adhere to pragmatism, I am a pragmatic designer and developer, approaching me is easy, but I don't work with everyone, you may use my character in this very article to decide, would I work with pornography? NO, just think. Here I am to help real people do real things, and the company I am with is as great as the company itself.
My name is Nathan M Allen, I'm here to help people gain back their digital soul, or at least their standard, no problem is too small, but I make a holistic analysis for every client, I look at as much as possible and require the same.

You may take a look at my portfolio, from the beginning I have used organic methods to rank my sites, I never did get around to using anything spam like, it was at my disposal and my time never did beg using spam like tactics, I always have had a new edge in organic which led me to believe in the unity of all these efforts, thanks for reading and look forward with me, please.
Sincerely, owner, creator, Nathan M Allen.
